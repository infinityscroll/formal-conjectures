# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 209

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

Per the WOWII definitions, $\lambda(v)$ is the local independence number (the
independence number of the subgraph induced on the neighbourhood of $v$, i.e.
`indepNeighborsCard`), $\lambda_{\max}(G)$ is its maximum over all vertices,
and the *frequency* of $\lambda_{\max}(G)$ is the number of vertices attaining
the maximum. Note that the original statement reads $|E(\bar G)|$ — the edge
count of the **complement** (rendered with an overline that is easy to miss in
plain-text copies of the list).

## Counterexample

For every $m \geq 7$, take a clique $K_m$ with a distinguished vertex $s$; add
two nonadjacent vertices, each adjacent to all of the clique except $s$; and
add two pendant vertices adjacent exactly to $s$. The resulting connected
graph on $m + 4$ vertices has $\lambda_{\max} = 3$ attained exactly at the $m$
clique vertices, and $|E(\bar G)| = 2m + 6$, so the premise
$(1/6)(1 + 2|E(\bar G)|) \leq \operatorname{freq}(\lambda_{\max})$ becomes
$4m + 13 \leq 6m$, which holds for all $m \geq 7$. Both pendant vertices must
be endpoints of any Hamiltonian path, yet both attach to the same vertex $s$,
so no Hamiltonian path exists.

The smallest member ($m = 7$) has 11 vertices and graph6 encoding
`J?o}]^Nr}^_`; an exhaustive search over all 1,018,690,325 connected graphs
on $4 \leq n \leq 11$ vertices (graphs on at most 3 vertices are trivially
traceable) shows it is the unique counterexample of minimum order.

WOWII [Conjecture 209](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

If $G$ is a simple connected graph with $n > 1$ such that
$\frac{1}{6}\left(1 + 2\,|E(\bar G)|\right) \leq$ frequency of
$\lambda_{\max}(G)$, then $G$ has a Hamiltonian path. Here $\bar G$ is the
complement of $G$, $\lambda_{\max}(G)$ is the maximum over all vertices of the
independence number of the neighbourhood, and the frequency is the number of
vertices attaining that maximum.
